- check for webkit and then Chrome - NOT A GOOD APPROACH THOUGH

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:
In nearly all cases you don't want to check if you're running under Google Chrome, but if the browser is using the WebKit rendering engine (see above). If you must look at the navigator.userAgent string look for the substring 'AppleWebKit', nothing else is guaranteed to continue working in the future!!

var isWebKit =
  navigator.userAgent.indexOf("AppleWebKit") > -1;
isWebKit will be true if you're running in Google Chrome, Safari or any other browser using WebKit.

To check the version of WebKit, use:

var WebKitVersion =
  parseFloat(navigator.userAgent.split("AppleWebKit/")[1]) ||
  undefined;
if (WebKitVersion && WebKitVersion > 500 ) {
  // use spiffy WebKit feature here
}
You can find a list of Google Chrome Releases and their corresponding WebKit revisions here.

Avoid code like the following:
if (isChrome) {
    doSomethingChromeSpecific();
} else {
  // Didn't detect browser type, so assume IE.
  doSomethingIESpecific();
}


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	The problem is that the above snippet assumes that any browser not explicitly identified is IE. 
	The problem is that it's far more likely for other browsers to act alike than it is for them to act like IE. 
	And IE9 is very similar to all other browsers, so the code fork is bound to fail. Stick to feature detection instead.

			<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought.</p>
